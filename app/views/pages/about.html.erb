<h1>About Us!</h1>
<p>Hi my name is Diana. At the age of 27 I choice to go natural. For thos eof you who don't nknow what that means I choice not to use harmful chemicls in my hair and embrace the natural curl pattern in which my hair growms. Needless to say, I started learning ho to do my hair at the age of 27. As I was doing research on how to style, manipulate, etc. my hair I wished there was one location where I could find out about everything. That's when i can up with the idea of a hair community. Where people with the same issues can give advice/ get advice from others</p>

<p>In a world were it is evident that love is needed, lets start in one place on a topic we can all relate to hair. Love starts from inside so lets express self love and in the process empower others to do the same.</p>
